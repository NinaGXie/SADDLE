# SADDLE
Descprition
Matlab and Python3 code and data for the paper "Designing Highly Multiplex PCR Primer Sets with Simulated Annealing Design using Dimer Likelihood Estimation (SADDLE)".

The folder ("NGS Analysis") contains a copy of the Matlab and python code of SADDLE NGS data analysis pipline. For details about running the code and interpreting the results, please refer to the "README.txt" inside the folder.
The folder ("Bowtie2_Reference_Sequence") contains a copy of the reference sequence we used to do Bowtie2 alignment.

We also provide the raw NGS data for SADDLE validation experiment at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.16944154.v1.

Requirements
Tested on python (tested with version 3.7.9) 
Tested on Matlab (tested with Matlab_R2020b)
